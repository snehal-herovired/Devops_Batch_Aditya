Both git fetch and git pull commands are used to download the changes in the content from the remote repository

GIT FETCH
==========
Git fetch command downloads the changes but will not execute anything it just specifies the changes in the remote repository to be
downloaded.

GIT PULL
========
Git pull command  unlike git fetch directly downloads the changes without the specifying the changes and executes it(merges it with our branch).

EXAMPLE
-------
Here in the screenshot i have first created a file in master branch and commited to it.
Then pushed it into the remote repository and made some changes to it and commited there.
After which i have used the command "git fetch" and i have seen that there are changes in the file but those are not exceuted yet.
Then i have used the "got pull " command to merge those changes into my file.
