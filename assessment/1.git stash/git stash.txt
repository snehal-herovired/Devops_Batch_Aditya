GIT STASH
==========
Git stash command is used to stash or save the file in which some changes are done and we are not ready to commit for then yet.
There are various commands which are used as extention with git stash like "git stash list ","git stash apply " etc.

EXAMPLE
-------
In the example from the screenshot i was first there in the master branch where I have created a file e.txt.
I have added and stashed it in that particular branch and didnot commit it.
I have made some changes in the e.txt file and then again stashed it using "git stash " command now i have moved to another branch named "sravya".
Now when i give the command "git stash list", i can see all of the stashes i have done in that branch.
There is another command called "git stash apply 0" with this command we will be able to see the first stash we have made(save).
