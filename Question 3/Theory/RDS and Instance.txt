To create an RDS connection with an EC2 instance and use it to create an SQL database and a sample table, you can follow the steps below:
..............................
Launch an EC2 instance:

1.Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2.Navigate to the EC2 service and click on "Launch Instance".
3.Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and an instance type.
4.Configure the instance details, such as the VPC, subnet, and security group.
5.Launch the instance and wait for it to be ready.

Create an RDS instance:

1.Navigate to the RDS service in the AWS Management Console.
2.Click on "Create Database" and choose the database engine you want to use (e.g., MySQL).
3.Configure the database settings, such as the instance type, storage, and backup options.
4.Set up the security group and create a master username and password.
5.Launch the instance and wait for it to be ready.


Connect to the RDS instance from the EC2 instance:

1.SSH into the EC2 instance.
2.Install the MySQL client by running the command: sudo yum install mysql
3.Connect to the RDS instance using the command: mysql -h <RDS endpoint> -P <port> -u <master username> -p
4.Enter the master password when prompted.


Create an SQL database:

.Once connected to the RDS instance, run the following SQL command to create a database: CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;

Create a sample table:

1.Run the following SQL command to switch to the newly created database: USE <database_name>;
2.Run the following SQL command to create a sample table: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id));
You have now created an RDS connection with an EC2 instance, created an SQL database, and a sample table.
