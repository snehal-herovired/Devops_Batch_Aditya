The git stash command saves a copy of your uncommitted changes in a queue, off to the side of your project.
git stash list [<options>]
git stash show [<stash>]
git stash drop 
git stash ( pop | apply ) 
git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]
# Your changes before stashing
git add . 

# Store the changes (stash)
git stash save "Saving changes from edit this file" 

# List stashed changes
git stash list 

# At this stage your local repo is clean
git status 

# To undo stash by popping the stash
git stash pop 

# Verify if the stash was popped
git stash list 

# Verify the pending changes before stash was done
git status
