Python Flask is a web application framework written in Python.
Dockerfile is a recipe to create an image.


Importing flask module in the project is mandatory.
Flask constructor takes the name of current module (__name__) as argument.
A Flask application is started by calling the run() method.
However, while the application is under development, it should be restarted manually for each change in the code. 

Using these commands in a docker file in python flask,
FROM,WORKDIR,RUN,COPY . . ,EXPOSE,CMD 
makes the docker file to perform respective functions.
