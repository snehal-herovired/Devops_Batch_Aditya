// git and github
// installation of git
// installation vscode
// we checked whether we can access git from vscode terminal

// GITHUB
// layman term => github is like a google drive to store and manage our code files
// we can store code files and image related to it and share with our partners or friends.

// Technial term 
// GITHUB is a version control system .
// version control :it is a system which is responsible for managing our codebases, we can upload 
 our code files, than we can also manage the changes to the code file, you can document about the 
the codebase,you can also manage large scale projects or websites or other important informations.

// Github => you go to google , github.com , signin and than you are in github homepage.
// github : remote things


// git => in your laptop ., this is local git 


// first step : GITHUB
// we are going to create a remote repository/folder with public access.

// now we go to local, and create some folder .
// we go to folder and in the address bar of that folder ,we write cmd
//commmand prompt will open and than we write code .
// We open VS code in that particular folder
// created a text and python file

// FOLDER LOCAL -LearningGit ====> REMOTE github Repsitory LearningGit

// LOCAL git =========>>>>> github.com our account and repository

// to write git commands , first way is to open cmd in the folder 
// you can open vscode in the folder , than go to vscode terminal and than write the commands
????? STARTING WITH GIT COMMAND

// git init : it will create a .git hidden folder inside your main folder
// .git hidden folder is empty ,it does not have any info.

//git status : it will help you find out if files in your folder are being tracked by git or not

// git add . : it will help you to add and track your files in git.

// git commit -m "learning funcdamentals of git" : it tell git that whatever files you added are perfectly
fine to be uploaded and i am commiting to this changes.

// git remote add origin https://github.com/snehal-herovired/LearningGIt.git : it will establish
a connection between local git and remote github.com repository.

// git push origin master : it will push/upload our all code which we commited to remote repository.
