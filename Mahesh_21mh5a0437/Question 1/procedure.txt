have created and pushed the java application folder. 
6. Now after pulling the files. 
7. Create 2 files for as “deploy.sh” and “checkstatus.sh”. 
8. And write the code for the CI-CD pipeline working in the both files . 
9. completing code in nano editor save the files and then open the CronTab . 
10.give the exact directory of the file which we are working on and the new 
file in which we have to save our data.
