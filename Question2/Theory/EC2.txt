An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
Amazon EC2 provides different instance types to enable you to choose the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity that you need to run your applications. 
Amazon EC2 supports On-Demand Instances (the default), Spot Instances, and Reserved Instances. 
AWS Systems Manager enables you to remotely and securely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances, 
and your on-premises instances and virtual machines (VMs) in hybrid environments, including VMs from other cloud providers.


DETAILED MONITORING:
By default, your instance is enabled for basic monitoring. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring. 
After you enable detailed monitoring, the Amazon EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1-minute period for the instance.
