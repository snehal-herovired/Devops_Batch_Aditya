The process of creating an EC2 instance for a ReactJS application and deploying it. Here are the steps:

Create an EC2 instance:

1.Login to your AWS console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2.Click on "Launch Instance" to create a new instance.
3.Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is suitable for your application. For a ReactJS application, you can choose a Linux-based AMI like Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
4.Select the instance type that meets your requirements. For a small application, you can choose a t2.micro instance.
5.Configure the instance details like network, subnet, and security group.
6.Add storage as per your requirements and click on "Review and Launch".
7.Review your instance configuration and click on "Launch".
8.Select an existing key pair or create a new one to securely connect to your instance.



Deploy the ReactJS application:

1.Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
2.Install the required dependencies for your ReactJS application like NodeJS, npm, etc.
3.Clone your ReactJS application repository from a Git repository using git clone command.
4.Navigate to the application directory using cd command and install the dependencies using npm install.
5.Build the application using npm run build command.
6.Start the application using npm start command.


Enable CloudWatch monitoring:

1.Go to the EC2 dashboard and select your instance.
2.Click on the "Monitoring" tab and then click on "Enable detailed monitoring".
3.This will enable CloudWatch monitoring for your instance.
4.You can also create custom CloudWatch alarms to monitor various metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, etc.


Get the Public IP:

1.Go to the EC2 dashboard and select your instance.
2.Look for the "IPv4 Public IP" column and copy the IP address.

That's it! You have successfully created an EC2 instance for your ReactJS application, deployed it, enabled CloudWatch monitoring, and obtained the public IP address.
