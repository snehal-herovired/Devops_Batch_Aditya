//Differenciation between fetch and pull:


-->"Git pull" is used to copy the contents directly into the local repository from remote repository, whereas "git fetch" shows the new change without merging them directly.

-->In "git fetch" the repository data is updated in .git and for "git pull" local repository is updated directly since the entire contents are copied/pulled.
