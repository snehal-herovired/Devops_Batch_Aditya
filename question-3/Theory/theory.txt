Connecting RDS to Ec2 instance:
  1)we need create Ec2 instance 
  steps for creating Ec2 instance:
      1)go to instance. launch instance and select any AMI (ubuntu) 
      2)select instance type and key pair 
      3)select network setting(SSH and everywhere) and launch instance
  2)we need to create database:
      1)go to RDS and create database and choose ease type and engine option(mysql)
      2)choose a sample template to meet your use case(free tier)
      3) In settings give database name and master username and password or you can choose auto generate password

      6)click on security group and edit inbounds rule and add rule and add the mysql 
      7)scroll down to the last and the connect the previously launched instance
    3)MAking connection between RDS and ec2 instance and creating sample table:
       1)select the instance and connect
       2)give the commands:
              => sudo su : to switch the root username
              => apt install mysql-client : to install the mysql-client
              => mysql --version : to check the version of the mysql
              =>mysql -h <database endpoint> -u <username> -p : this is the command to get into your RDS after that enter the password
              =>the connection is established between the ec2 and RDS
              here is the commands for creating sample table:
                 create database sandhya;
                 use sandhya;
                 create table student (id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,name VARCHAR(40).BRANCH VARCHAR(10),PRIMARY KEY(id);
                 insert into student (name,Branch) values ('sandhya','ECE'),('deepika','ECE'),('bhavana','ECE');
                 select * from student;
