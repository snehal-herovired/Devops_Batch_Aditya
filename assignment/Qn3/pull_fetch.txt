When comparing Git pull vs fetch, Git fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote but doesn't make any changes to your local files. 
On the other hand, Git pull is faster as you're performing multiple actions in one â€“ a better bang for your buck.
commands used for fetch and pull :
git fetch
git pull <link>
