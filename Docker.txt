// Docker 
: Docker is a tool or application which enables us to create containers.

// Docker : Docker desktop 
: Docker desktop : server , engine : docker daemon
                 : client , CLI ,apis
                 : HUB ,docker hub

// docker has client-server architecture :

Dockerfile : recipe to create docker image

FROM : it defines which service image to be used for your application
WORKDIR : it defines the folder structure of the application inside the container and 
where everything you download willbe .

COPY file_which_contains_our_application_dependency.
example : nodejs : package.json ,python_flask: requirements.txt

RUN : it tells docker to perform installation of whatever is there in your dependecy file.

COPY . . : it tells to copy all the stuff just got downladed and keep it in the desired folder structure

EXPOSE : it tells docker that our application will run on port 3000 inside the container. 

CMD : ["node","index.js"] : it tells docker to run this command in command line environment 
to start the application



Docker CLI commands :

1. docker login :used for authenticating the user on docker.

4. docker pull image_name : command to pull images from remote docker hub.
5. docker images --help : --help is a mode to see list of other modes and infos related the command
6. docker run  -it  _image_name |_imageID : to run the image and make a container.
7. docker ps : will show the running containers
8. docker inspect image_name : details of images.
9. docker rmi image_name|imageID :delete image
10. docker system --help :docker system related commands
11. docker system df : disk usage of docker.
12. docker build -t app_name . : build image out of docker file and . here specifies that dockerfile
 is in this particular folder/directory
13. docker build -t app.name:1.0 . : it will create images with tags
