Instance : An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud for running applications on the Amazon web services(AWS) infrastructure.

Reactjs appalication: React is a declarative,efficientand flexible java script libraryfor building user interfaces.

* Cloud monitoring is a method of reviewing, observing, and managing the operational workflow in a cloud-based IT infrastructure.

steps for creating an ec2 instance:

* Signin to aws management console then select ec2 instance and click on launch instance
* After that enter name of instance and select application and os image(amazon machine image) of ubuntu
*select instance type and give keypair details
* then click on network settings and edit the settings then click on launch instance
*instance is getting launched after launching the instance connect the instance
and give the following commands

Deploying reactjs application on ec2 instance through the following commands:

#Update ubuntu instance
sudo apt-get update

#Upgrade ubuntu system
sudo apt-get upgrade

#install ngnix
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

#nginx version
nginx -v

#restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

#install nodejs ubuntu
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

#reate the react project. (create-react-app)
npx create-react-app react-tutorial

#Build the react project
cd react-tutorial
npm run build

#Run the project
npm start

* after all these commands we get succesful compilation message
*then go to instance and select security group id and edit the inbound rules 
select type:custom tcp
port range:3000 then save rules
*in new tab enter public ip followed by port number
100.24.235.254:3000
*finally we get reactapp
* in instance we select detail monitoring and monitor with the help of cloud watch 
* we are able to watch in the form of graphs.
