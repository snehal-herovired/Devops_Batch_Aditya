Q2. Create an EC2 intance for a Reactjs application and deploy the application and provide the public ip for it, also enable the cloud monitoriing on this estances
Step 1:
      For this first we have to create the ec2 instance inthe aws console management which is created in ubuntu linux 
Step 2:
      Then we have to check that the server is running or not and we have to wait until that the server is to be run 
Step 3:
      We have to update that the ubuntu linux by using the command sudo apt-get update : this command is used to update the command
      Then we have to use the command the command sudo apt-get upgrade that the content in the ubuntu linux server 
Step 4: 
      Now we have to install the ngnix in it so we have to use the command 'sudo apt-get install ngnix-y'
Step 5:
      Next we have to check the ngnix the version for that we have to check 'ngnix-v' 
Step 6:
      Now we have to restart the ngnix for that we have to use the command 'sudo systemctl restart ngnix'
Step 7:
      Now We have to install the nodejs in the ubuntu server 'sudo apt-get install curl' this command is used for for installing the nodejs 
      then we have to use the command is used to command 'curl-sL httpd://httpds://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x |sudo -E bash-'  then we        
      have to use the command the 'sudo apt-get install-y nodejs ' for installing and updating the nodejs 

Step 8:
      now we have to create the react project we are using the command 'npx create-react-app react tutorial' for creating the react    
      application 
Step 9:
      Now we have to build the react project so we have to using the  command 'cd react-tutorial' next 'npm run build' for building and           
      running  to the nodejs 
Step 10:
        Now we have to use the command 'npm start' for starting the build nodejs in it
Step 11:
        Now we got the port of 3000 for nodejs so that that the application of nodejs is deoloyed in the ec2 instance
Step 12:
        For making that the nodejs is to run we have to go to the securitygroups then editoinbounds then  we have to give the port number 
        3000 to get the nodejs application in it
