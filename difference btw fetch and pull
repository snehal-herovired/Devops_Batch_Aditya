1)Git fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote 
repository without bringing the changes into the local repository.
2)Git pull on the other hand brings the copy of remote directory changes into the local repository

3)Repository data is updates in the .git directory
but in the case git pull, the local repository is updated directly

4)in case of fetch there is no possibility of merge conflicts but in case of get pull there is a poosibility if the remote and the local repositories have done changes at the same place
